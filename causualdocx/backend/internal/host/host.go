// Package host defines the integration interface every document
// source must satisfy. The gateway calls Fetch on room creation
// to seed the in-memory Y.Doc; calls Snapshot on room drain
// (last-client disconnect) to persist the latest state.
//
// Three implementations are planned (see docs/05-backend-design.md):
//
//  1. inline  — in-process map. The v0 share-link flow: a user
//     uploads `.docx` to the gateway, gets a docId + share URL,
//     others join, anyone downloads. No external host. This
//     package's `inline` subpackage.
//  2. wopi    — full WOPI HTTP client (Nextcloud, SharePoint, …).
//     Future v1.
//  3. jwtapi  — leaner "WOPI-like but simpler" REST client: GET
//     <fetchURL> + POST <callbackURL> with `Authorization: Bearer
//     <jwt>`. Future v1+.
//
// The room manager never cases on host type — it calls the
// interface. Concrete impl is selected once at startup via env
// var / config and stays put for the gateway's lifetime.

// uses directly: upload + persistence + history + rename. Every

// join (with a freshly-minted lockID it remembers for the room's
// lifetime), Unlock once on last client leave, and RefreshLock
// periodically while the room is alive (the period is the room
// manager's choice; WOPI hosts typically expect a refresh every
// ~5-10 min). The same lockID is used for every call within a
// room's lifetime.
//
// Hosts that don't have lock semantics (inline, local) simply don't
// implement this interface; the room manager checks via type
// assertion and skips the calls when the capability isn't there.
//

// RevisionStore is an optional host capability: it returns the .docx

// omit it — the gateway then surfaces 501 for the restore-download
