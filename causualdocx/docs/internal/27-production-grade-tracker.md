# 27 — Production-Grade Suite Tracker

**Date:** 2026-06-26  
**Status:** Active execution tracker  
**Target:** A reliable, polished, production-grade self-hosted office suite where Casual Docs can stand credibly against LibreOffice Writer and OnlyOffice Document Editor, and share one collaboration protocol/server with Casual Sheets and Casual Slides.

This tracker is intentionally strict. A task is not done because the feature appears to work in a demo. A task is done only when the acceptance gate, regression coverage, deployment path, recovery behavior, and user-facing UX are complete.

Status legend:

- **Covered** — code/tests/docs already satisfy the acceptance gate.
- **Partial** — meaningful implementation or tests exist, but the production gate is not fully closed.
- **Todo** — not found in the current codebase or docs audit.
- **Verify** — likely present, but needs a focused run or deeper inspection before marking covered.

---

## Product Standard

The target product must feel like a real office tool:

- Reliable under crash, refresh, network drop, browser close, server restart, and concurrent editing.
- Clean and predictable UI: no debug-feeling controls, no inconsistent dialogs, no hidden critical actions, no confusing states.
- Accessible by default: keyboard, screen reader, high contrast, dark mode, reduced motion, focus visibility, target size, and IME/CJK are part of the release bar.
- Fidelity-first: `.docx` output must not silently damage user documents.
- Operator-friendly: one documented production topology, persistent storage, backups, health checks, metrics, and upgrade path.
- Suite-ready: Docs, Sheets, and Slides use the same collaboration service, auth concepts, sharing semantics, storage contract, and deployment model.

## Architecture Direction

The forward backend is the shared Node/TypeScript `@casualoffice/collab` server:

- Hocuspocus + Yjs on Fastify.
- One authoritative `Y.Doc` per room.
- Format-agnostic room, auth, sharing, snapshot, and persistence primitives.
- Used by Docs, Sheets, and future Slides.
- Stores opaque file bytes and Yjs updates; editor-specific serialization remains in the product clients unless a dedicated headless serializer is introduced.

The legacy Go gateway remains transitional:

- It can continue serving SPA, upload/download, and historical compatibility during migration.
- It must not receive new realtime collaboration or snapshot architecture work.
- Public docs must stop presenting the legacy Go y-websocket path as the primary production architecture.

## Global Release Gates

No production-grade release until all gates below are green.

| Gate | Required bar | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reliability | User edits survive refresh, tab close, browser crash simulation, network drop/reconnect, collab server restart, gateway restart, and storage restart within documented guarantees. | E2E + integration tests, manual failure runbook. |
| Persistence | Production deploy refuses or loudly warns on non-persistent collab storage. | Startup validation + deployment docs + health endpoint. |
| Fidelity | Round-trip stays pristine; visual fidelity floor stays locked; extreme corpus regressions are tracked and blocked when severe. | Roundtrip audit, visual fidelity CI, fixture corpus report. |
| Collaboration | Two+ peers converge across text, tables, images, comments, track changes, footnotes/endnotes, properties, version history, and strict mode. | Live-server multi-peer Playwright suite. |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.2 AA target for app chrome and core workflows; documented exceptions for document content authored by users. | axe checks, keyboard scripts, contrast audit, manual AT matrix. |
| UX/UI | Core workflows are discoverable, consistent, and polished in light/dark themes at desktop and mobile-width shells. | UX checklist, screenshots, reviewed flows. |
| Deployment | One official production topology with reverse proxy, persistent storage, backups, health, logs, and upgrade guidance. | `deploy/` docs + smoke script. |
| Security | Share links, roles, view-only enforcement, auth tokens, password handling, upload limits, and CORS/base-path behavior are tested. | Security test suite + threat checklist. |
| Observability | Operators can tell whether sync, storage, snapshot, auth, and frontend asset serving are healthy. | `/health`, `/ready`, structured logs, metrics. |
| CI consistency | Every change has a trustworthy blast-radius signal: unit, integration, Playwright, visual, fidelity, and deploy smoke failures are deterministic and actionable. | Required CI matrix, flake budget, test ownership map, failure triage labels. |

---

## Phase 0 — Tracker Hygiene And Architecture Truth

**Goal:** Remove ambiguity. Everyone should know that the Node collab server is the forward path.

| ID | Task | Acceptance gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0.1 | Update README architecture claims from Go/y-websocket to Node/Hocuspocus collab. | README stack table, collaboration section, Docker section, and API surface no longer contradict `deploy/README.md`. | Todo |
| P0.2 | Mark legacy Go realtime gateway as transitional everywhere. | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `00-overview.md`, deployment docs, and Docker comments consistently describe current vs legacy responsibilities. | Partial — `00-overview.md` and deploy docs are current; README/Docker comments still drift. |
| P0.3 | Define the official production topology. | One canonical diagram: `gateway/static + collab + persistent storage + reverse proxy`; single-container legacy path labeled dev/demo only. | Covered — `deploy/README.md`, `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`, and `deploy/Caddyfile` define gateway + collab + proxy. |
| P0.4 | Add a decision record for “one shared collab server across Docs/Sheets/Slides.” | Decision states why: shared protocol, fewer servers, common auth/share semantics, common operator story. | Partial — `23-collab-server-migration.md` covers Docs/Sheets; formal suite-wide ADR still useful. |
| P0.5 | Create a release checklist template. | Every release must attach gate status: fidelity, collab, a11y, UX, security, deploy, rollback. | Todo |

**Exit criteria:** Public-facing docs, internal docs, and deployment docs tell the same story.

---

## Phase 1 — Production Collaboration Foundation

**Goal:** Make shared Node/Hocuspocus collaboration the reliable default, not a migration experiment.

| ID | Task | Acceptance gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1.1 | Make persistent collab storage mandatory for production. | Server logs fatal or readiness fails when `NODE_ENV=production` and storage is in-memory, unless an explicit unsafe override is set. | Todo — actual code uses in-memory Y.Doc storage unless `REDIS_URL` is set (`collab/src/storage.ts`). `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` sets `CASUAL_STORAGE=local`, but that only selects workbook file storage via `createHost()`. |
| P1.2 | Define storage backend contract for Y.Doc snapshots. | `memory`, `local`, `s3`, `postgres`, and Redis/Yjs snapshot storage have documented durability, TTL, backup, and recovery guarantees. | Partial — workbook host backends are memory/local/s3/postgres; Y.Doc storage is only memory/Redis and Redis has a 7-day idle TTL. Docs currently blur these two storage systems. |
| P1.3 | Add collab health and readiness checks. | Readiness separately reports HTTP, Hocuspocus upgrade, storage load/save/delete, auth resolver, and room registry. | Partial — `/health` exists with room count; deeper readiness is not complete. |
| P1.4 | Add same-origin `/yjs` smoke test. | Script starts gateway + collab + proxy, opens two clients, verifies sync, view-only, reconnect, and snapshot reload. | Todo |
| P1.5 | Add multi-peer Docs convergence tests against real collab server. | Tests cover text, formatting, tables, images, comments, footnotes/endnotes, props, track changes, strict co-editing. | Partial — unit transport coverage exists for comments/footnotes/props/strict mode; real live-server Docs e2e still needed. |
| P1.6 | Add disconnect/reconnect resilience tests. | Simulate server restart, WS close, network offline/online, tab reload; peers converge without duplicate/lost content. | Todo |
| P1.7 | Enforce view-only server-side. | Crafted client cannot mutate a view-only room; test bypasses UI and sends direct Yjs update. | Partial — Hocuspocus `connection.readOnly` is implemented; direct crafted-update test should be added. |
| P1.8 | Define room lifecycle rules. | TTL, max rooms, eviction, password/share-token behavior, and persisted-room retention are documented and tested. | Covered — `rooms.unit.test.ts` and join-role/share tests cover caps, eviction, protected rooms, tokens, expiry, password checks. |
| P1.9 | Unify role model across suite. | Docs and Sheets use the same role names, role precedence, share-token binding, and URL parameters. | Partial — collab join-role and personal share APIs are tested; suite-level contract still needs formalization. |
| P1.10 | Build collab operational dashboard endpoint. | Admin/health output shows room count, connected peers, storage backend, pending saves, and recent errors without leaking document content. | Partial — admin config and `/api/rooms` exist; production-safe ops dashboard is not complete. |
| P1.11 | Flush debounced Y.Doc saves on shutdown. | SIGTERM/server close persists every queued room update before destroying Hocuspocus/storage, with a bounded timeout and test. | Todo — `attachHocuspocus().close()` clears pending save timers but stores only timer handles, so edits inside the 500 ms debounce window can be dropped on shutdown. |

**Exit criteria:** A production deploy can run collab for Docs with persistent state, tested reconnection, tested view-only enforcement, and no dependency on the legacy Go realtime path.

---

## Phase 2 — Save, Snapshot, Versioning, And Recovery

**Goal:** User work must survive real failure modes.

| ID | Task | Acceptance gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P2.1 | Define authoritative save model. | Clear spec for client `.docx` bytes, server Y.Doc state, host file bytes, version history, and conflict resolution. | Todo |
| P2.2 | Add crash-safe autosave tests. | Browser page crash/reload retains latest acknowledged edits or shows clear recovery UI for pending local edits. | Partial — local autosave restore/banner and autosave indicator tests exist; real browser crash + collab/server recovery gate remains. |
| P2.3 | Add pagehide/beforeunload save behavior audit. | Large docs either save safely before unload or communicate “sync pending” without pretending success. | Partial — `useFileSourceAutoSave` flushes on `visibilitychange` and `pagehide`, with unit coverage; large-doc/server-backed reliability still needs proof. |
| P2.4 | Add host version conflict UX. | If `If-Match`/WOPI/local version mismatches, user sees conflict flow, not silent overwrite. | Partial — backend/collab tests cover stale etag/version mismatch; end-user conflict UX needs verification. |
| P2.5 | Make version history production-grade. | Named versions, auto versions, restore, delete, rename, preview, and diff are tested with collab and storage restart. | Partial — version history, audit, preview, and panel layout Playwright tests exist; storage-restart/collab integration remains. |
| P2.6 | Add backup/restore runbook. | Operator can restore collab Y.Doc snapshot and host file bytes to a previous known-good version. | Todo |
| P2.7 | Add “last saved / saving / offline / error” status model. | Status is consistent across title bar, file source, collab, and version history. | Partial — `AutosaveStatus` exposes saving/saved/error with `aria-live`; it is not yet unified with collab connection and version-history status. |
| P2.8 | Define final-drain snapshot strategy. | Either server can produce final file snapshot, or product explicitly guarantees client-push only with UI/ops safeguards. No vague middle state. | Todo |
| P2.9 | Add data-loss incident tests. | Kill browser, collab, gateway, and storage in separate tests; assert exact expected recovery behavior. | Todo |

**Exit criteria:** We can state exactly when a user edit is durable, prove it, and recover from failure without data loss surprises.

---

## Phase 3 — Fidelity And Document Safety

**Goal:** Do not damage real user documents.

| ID | Task | Acceptance gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P3.1 | Keep round-trip audit mandatory. | CI fails if pristine fixture count drops or any known OOXML preservation bucket regresses. | Covered — `ci.yml` runs `scripts/roundtrip-audit.mjs`; many focused OOXML unit tests exist. |
| P3.2 | Keep visual fidelity CI mandatory. | Visual-fidelity floor and page-count mismatch limits are enforced in CI for representative corpus. | Covered — `visual-fidelity.yml` enforces representative corpus floor and uploads reports. |
| P3.3 | Build extreme-corpus tracker. | CJK SDS, dense forms, table-heavy docs, image-heavy docs, and legal/medical templates have named scores and owners. | Todo |
| P3.4 | Fix exact line-height model for dense/CJK docs. | Target fixtures improve without regressing everyday corpus or round-trip audit. | Todo |
| P3.5 | Fix measured table row geometry. | Dense forms do not drift by accumulated row-height error across pages. | Todo |
| P3.6 | Preserve drawings/images through collab save paths. | Multi-peer edit/save/reopen tests verify images, shapes, textboxes, anchors, wraps, and raw XML envelopes survive. | Partial — shapes and text boxes carry `rawXml`/`envelopeKey` through PM/Yjs; images have serializer support but the PM image schema/conversion path does not carry those fields yet. |
| P3.7 | Expand imported equation editability. | Imported Word equation opens with meaningful editable representation or clear replace-only UX. | Partial — equation render/insert/edit tests exist; imported OMML-to-edit-source gap remains. |
| P3.8 | Add document safety warnings. | If a feature is unsupported or degraded on import, user gets a non-alarming but clear warning before save/export when risk is real. | Todo |
| P3.9 | Add real-world fixture intake process. | New customer/user docs can be anonymized, scored, classified, and tracked without ad hoc one-off debugging. | Todo |

**Exit criteria:** Normal documents are stable, extreme documents are honestly tracked, and unsupported fidelity cases are visible rather than silent.

---

## Phase 4 — Accessibility, WCAG, IME, And Dark Mode

**Goal:** Accessibility is a product feature, not a patch.

| ID | Task | Acceptance gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P4.1 | Define WCAG 2.2 AA target scope. | Scope separates app chrome/editor workflows from user-authored document content. Exceptions are documented. | Todo |
| P4.2 | Add automated contrast audit. | Light/dark chrome tokens and rendered components fail CI below 4.5:1 for normal text or 3:1 for UI graphics/large text. | Todo |
| P4.3 | Fix dark-mode weak text tokens. | Placeholder/helper/metadata text that users must read meets contrast; disabled-only text remains visually disabled but not used for instructions. | Todo |
| P4.4 | Add axe checks for core workflows. | Home, editor, file menu, share dialog, find/replace, comments, version history, properties, image/table panels, equation dialog. | Partial — editor a11y contract and accessibility dialog tests exist; axe workflow suite not found. |
| P4.5 | Add keyboard-only workflow tests. | Open, edit, format, find/replace, comment, track changes, version restore, share, table editing, image formatting all work without mouse. | Partial — broad keyboard/shortcut Playwright coverage exists; needs explicit keyboard-only workflow map. |
| P4.6 | Add focus-order and focus-visible tests. | No invisible focus, no focus trap leaks, no focus hidden behind overlays, no obscured focused control. | Partial — focus recapture/cursor focus tests and global focus CSS exist; full focus-order gate remains. |
| P4.7 | Validate screen-reader contract manually. | NVDA + Firefox/Chrome, JAWS + Chrome, VoiceOver + Safari: editing, navigation, toolbar, dialogs, comments, status messages. | Todo |
| P4.8 | Fix IME/CJK input architecture. | Japanese, Chinese, Korean composition candidate window appears in correct viewport location and text commits correctly. | Partial — `ime-caret-sync.spec.ts` covers candidate-window positioning mechanism; full IME/CJK manual/browser matrix remains. |
| P4.9 | Add reduced-motion and high-contrast pass. | Animations respect reduced motion; forced-colors/high-contrast mode keeps controls visible and usable. | Todo |
| P4.10 | Add target-size audit. | Mobile/touch controls meet WCAG 2.2 target-size expectations or documented exceptions; no tiny critical controls. | Todo |

**Exit criteria:** We can make a cautious WCAG 2.2 AA claim for app chrome/core workflows with evidence, not vibes.

---

## Phase 5 — UI/UX Polish And Workflow Quality

**Goal:** The editor should feel calm, clean, predictable, and professional.

| ID | Task | Acceptance gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P5.1 | Establish design QA checklist. | Every flow is reviewed for spacing, typography, target size, hover/pressed/focus states, empty/loading/error states, and dark mode. | Todo |
| P5.2 | Normalize component primitives. | Buttons, icon buttons, menus, dialogs, tabs, inputs, tooltips, popovers, and side panels use shared primitives or documented exceptions. | Todo |
| P5.3 | Audit all inline styles. | Inline styles are removed or justified where they block theme, focus, contrast, or consistency. | Todo |
| P5.4 | Polish title bar and toolbar. | Toolbar controls are dense but not cramped; groups are consistent; labels/tooltips/shortcuts are clear; overflow is predictable. | Todo |
| P5.5 | Polish right rail. | Comments, properties, track changes, version history, AI/writing, and outline do not fight for space; one active surface is obvious. | Todo |
| P5.6 | Polish share/collab UX. | Share flow clearly distinguishes edit/view links, password/share-token role, copy success, connection state, and permission errors. | Todo |
| P5.7 | Polish recovery UX. | Offline, reconnecting, saving failed, conflict, restore autosave, and version restore states are understandable and non-destructive. | Todo |
| P5.8 | Polish dark mode. | No light flashes, low-contrast labels, mismatched surfaces, hardcoded colors, or unreadable icons in dark mode. | Todo |
| P5.9 | Polish mobile/narrow shell. | App is usable at narrow widths for review/light editing; unsupported desktop-only actions degrade cleanly. | Todo |
| P5.10 | Add screenshot review suite. | Playwright captures canonical light/dark screenshots for main workflows and flags obvious UI regressions. | Partial — visual regression screenshots and version-history visual audit exist; canonical light/dark workflow suite remains. |

**Exit criteria:** The product no longer feels like a demo shell around a powerful engine.

---

## Phase 6 — Security, Auth, Sharing, And Admin

**Goal:** Self-hosted production customers can operate it safely.

| ID | Task | Acceptance gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P6.1 | Threat-model share links. | Documented risks: token leakage, password brute force, view-only bypass, room guessing, replay, expiration, revocation. | Todo |
| P6.2 | Rate-limit sensitive routes. | Login, share validation, uploads, room creation, password checks, and admin routes have tested limits. | Partial — collab rate-limit plumbing exists; route-by-route production verification needed. |
| P6.3 | Harden upload handling. | File size, extension, MIME sniffing, zip bombs, corrupt OOXML, malformed XML, and worker failures are handled. | Partial — upload limits/tests exist in gateway/collab; complete adversarial-file suite remains. |
| P6.4 | Unify JWT/share-token semantics. | Docs/Sheets/Slides use same claim shape, lateral-access guard, expiry, role mapping, and feature flags. | Partial — collab auth/share-token tests are extensive; suite-wide contract remains. |
| P6.5 | Make admin UI production-safe. | Secrets redacted, config write validates, audit log records changes, dangerous toggles warn clearly. | Partial — admin config/routes/webhook tests exist; audit log/dangerous-toggle UX remains. |
| P6.6 | Add audit logs. | Share created, joined, saved, version restored, file renamed, permission changed, admin config changed. | Todo |
| P6.7 | Define CORS/base-path/proxy policy. | Same-origin deploy is default; cross-origin embed is explicit and tested. | Todo |
| P6.8 | Add dependency/license gate. | No AGPL contamination in editor path; security scan and license report run before release. | Todo |

**Exit criteria:** A serious operator can deploy this without accepting hidden security assumptions.

---

## Phase 7 — Deployment, Operations, And Scale

**Goal:** Installation and operation are boring.

| ID | Task | Acceptance gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P7.1 | Official Docker Compose production stack. | Gateway, collab, storage, reverse proxy, volumes, health checks, restart policy, and example env are complete. | Partial — stack/proxy files exist, but production Y.Doc persistence is misconfigured (`CASUAL_STORAGE=local` does not affect `DocStorage`) and readiness/health checks are insufficient. |
| P7.2 | Kubernetes reference manifest. | Optional but production-ready: deployments, services, ingress, probes, secrets, persistent volumes. | Todo |
| P7.3 | Backup and restore docs. | Host files, collab snapshots, user DB, admin config, and version history backup/restore are covered. | Todo |
| P7.4 | Observability package. | Structured logs, request IDs, room IDs, user/session IDs where safe, metrics, and health dashboard. | Todo |
| P7.5 | Load test suite. | Concurrent rooms, concurrent users per room, large docs, reconnect storm, autosave storm, upload storm. | Partial — collab load/wsload scripts exist; production thresholds and CI/nightly use remain. |
| P7.6 | Upgrade/migration playbook. | Versioned config, DB migrations, Y.Doc snapshot compatibility, rollback plan, blue/green notes. | Todo |
| P7.7 | Resource sizing guide. | CPU/RAM/storage estimates for small, medium, large deployments. | Todo |
| P7.8 | Failure-mode runbook. | What to do when collab cannot save, storage is down, proxy WS upgrade breaks, or host returns version conflict. | Todo |

**Exit criteria:** A non-core developer can deploy, monitor, upgrade, and recover the system.

---

## Phase 8 — Suite Integration

**Goal:** Users experience one office product, not separate experiments.

| ID | Task | Acceptance gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P8.1 | Shared file/home shell. | Open/recent/share/version/auth flows are consistent across Docs, Sheets, and Slides. | Todo |
| P8.2 | Shared collab service contract. | Product-specific clients use the same room creation, role, snapshot, storage, and health APIs. | Todo |
| P8.3 | Shared admin and storage config. | Operators configure storage/auth/proxy/webhooks once for the suite or with clear per-product overrides. | Todo |
| P8.4 | Shared desktop bridge contract. | Ubuntu/macOS/Windows desktop shell opens local files, routes by extension, saves safely, and disables unsupported collab flows offline. | Todo |
| P8.5 | Cross-product visual identity. | Docs, Sheets, Slides feel related but not identical; each product has appropriate density and controls. | Todo |
| P8.6 | Cross-product release gate. | A suite release cannot ship if one product breaks auth, sharing, storage, or collab contract. | Todo |

**Exit criteria:** A user can install one product suite and use documents/spreadsheets/presentations with consistent behavior.

---

## Phase 9 — Competitive Feature Closure

**Goal:** Close the gaps users expect from LibreOffice and OnlyOffice alternatives.

| ID | Task | Acceptance gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P9.1 | Document comparison. | Compare two `.docx` files and produce readable insert/delete changes. | Todo |
| P9.2 | Mail merge. | Data source + field insertion + preview + export; interoperable with Word where possible. | Todo |
| P9.3 | Forms/content controls. | SDT controls render, edit, validate, and round-trip. | Todo |
| P9.4 | Broader style management. | Create/modify paragraph and character styles without breaking OOXML inheritance. | Todo |
| P9.5 | Navigator/outline parity. | Large-doc navigation covers headings, tables, images, comments, changes, footnotes/endnotes. | Todo |
| P9.6 | Advanced WOPI polish. | Lock/refresh/unlock, version, rename, permissions, and host error UX match enterprise expectations. | Todo |
| P9.7 | Offline-first desktop. | Local files, crash recovery, file associations, recent files, and auto-update are reliable on Ubuntu/macOS/Windows. | Todo |

**Exit criteria:** The product can be honestly compared with LibreOffice/OnlyOffice for serious document work, with documented remaining gaps.

---

## Phase 10 — CI, Playwright, And Blast-Radius Discipline

**Goal:** CI is a product safety system. It must be fast enough to run often, broad enough to catch regressions, and stable enough that failures are trusted.

| ID | Task | Acceptance gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P10.1 | Create a test ownership map. | Every suite has an owner area: fidelity, editor input, collab, file source, UX chrome, accessibility, deployment, backend, storage. | Todo |
| P10.2 | Define test tiers. | `PR quick`, `PR full`, `nightly stress`, and `release candidate` are documented with exact commands and pass criteria. | Partial — CI has lint/unit/build/roundtrip/sharded e2e/backend plus separate visual/fidelity workflows; formal tier policy remains. |
| P10.3 | Make Playwright workflow coverage explicit. | Each core user workflow maps to at least one Playwright test: open, edit, save, collab, share, comment, track changes, version restore, table, image, equation, find/replace, export. | Partial — broad workflow coverage exists; needs an explicit coverage map rather than discovery by filename. |
| P10.4 | Add blast-radius labels to tests. | Failing test names or metadata identify the impacted surface: `fidelity`, `collab`, `a11y`, `dark-mode`, `save`, `storage`, `ux`, `security`, `deploy`. | Partial — many filenames are descriptive; no formal metadata/label taxonomy found. |
| P10.5 | Eliminate silent flaky tests. | Flakes are quarantined only with an issue and owner; release candidate cannot pass with quarantined production-critical workflows. | Todo |
| P10.6 | Add CI artifact discipline. | Playwright traces, screenshots, videos, visual diffs, fidelity reports, and logs are uploaded consistently and linked from failed jobs. | Partial — Playwright HTML/screenshots and visual/fidelity reports upload; broader logs/traces/deploy artifacts need standardization. |
| P10.7 | Add deterministic seed data. | Fixtures, users, share tokens, room IDs, timestamps, and random colors are controlled enough to avoid snapshot noise. | Todo |
| P10.8 | Add cross-browser minimum. | Chromium remains primary; Firefox/WebKit smoke cover accessibility, editing, save, and layout assumptions before production release. | Todo |
| P10.9 | Add dark-mode and accessibility Playwright pass. | Same workflow tests run in light and dark where relevant; axe/focus/keyboard failures block release. | Partial — a11y/IME/focus tests exist; dark-mode and axe matrix remains. |
| P10.10 | Add collab CI service topology. | CI starts real gateway + real collab + persistent test storage + proxy, not mocked peers only. | Todo |
| P10.11 | Add deploy smoke test. | Built production compose stack is started, health/readiness checked, two-peer edit/save/reload verified, then cleanly torn down. | Todo |
| P10.12 | Add performance budgets. | Large-doc open, type, save, collab sync, and version preview have thresholds with trend artifacts. | Partial — large-doc performance Playwright exists; trend/artifact/budget policy remains. |
| P10.13 | Add failure triage protocol. | Red CI is categorized as product regression, test bug, infra bug, or known flaky; every category has a required follow-up. | Todo |
| P10.14 | Add release-candidate CI gate. | A release candidate runs full matrix: unit, typecheck, lint, roundtrip, visual fidelity, Playwright, accessibility, collab, backend, deploy smoke. | Todo |

**Exit criteria:** When CI is red, the team can quickly tell what broke, where the blast radius is, and whether the product is safe to ship.

---

## Strict Definition Of Done

Every production task must satisfy all applicable items:

1. User-facing behavior implemented.
2. Error, empty, loading, offline, and permission-denied states implemented.
3. Light and dark themes reviewed.
4. Keyboard path works.
5. Screen-reader semantics are present for interactive controls.
6. Tests added at the lowest useful level and at least one user-flow level for risky behavior.
7. Failure mode is documented.
8. Deployment/ops implications are documented.
9. No regression in round-trip audit, visual-fidelity gate, typecheck, unit tests, and e2e smoke.
10. The test added for the change is correctly placed in the test pyramid; broad Playwright coverage is used for user workflows, not as a substitute for focused unit/integration coverage.
11. CI failure output is actionable: test name, artifact, trace/log, and affected surface are clear.
12. Product copy is honest: no “production”, “WCAG”, “lossless”, “self-hosted”, or “compatible” claim without evidence.

---

## Immediate Next Sprint

The next sprint should not add new flashy features. It should remove production ambiguity.

1. Update README, Dockerfile comments, and architecture docs to make Node/Hocuspocus collab the canonical backend.
2. Fix production collab persistence: either require `REDIS_URL` in prod compose/docs or implement a real local/s3/postgres `DocStorage` path for Y.Doc updates.
3. Add production readiness failure for in-memory collab storage and a storage write/read/delete probe.
4. Fix Hocuspocus shutdown drain so queued debounced saves are persisted before process exit.
5. Add same-origin `/yjs` two-peer smoke test.
6. Add image `rawXml`/`envelopeKey` carriage through the PM/Yjs image node path, then test save/reopen through collab.
7. Add dark-mode contrast audit script for design tokens and rendered core chrome.
8. Add axe checks for editor, share dialog, comments, version history, and properties dialog.
9. Add crash/reconnect autosave test for Docs against the real collab server.
10. Create CI/test ownership map and label existing Playwright suites by blast radius.
11. Create release checklist template and require it for any “production” release candidate.

## Implementation Evidence Counted In This Tracker

This section exists to prevent duplicate work and to keep the tracker honest. The status calls above are based on implementation paths, not only workflow names.

- **Collab server boot path:** `collab/src/index.ts` creates `DocStorage` first, logs Redis vs in-memory storage, then creates separate workbook file hosting via `createHost()`. This proves collab Y.Doc storage and workbook file storage are different systems.
- **Y.Doc persistence:** `collab/src/storage.ts` implements only `InMemoryStorage` and `RedisStorage`; `createStorage()` ignores `CASUAL_STORAGE` and selects Redis only when `REDIS_URL` exists.
- **Production deploy mismatch:** `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` sets `CASUAL_STORAGE=local` and `CASUAL_LOCAL_PATH=/data` under a comment that says it persists Y.Doc snapshots, but those env vars are consumed by `collab/src/host/index.ts`, not by `DocStorage`.
- **Hocuspocus lifecycle:** `collab/src/yjs.ts` loads seed + persisted updates, enforces share-token/view-only roles server-side, queues debounced saves on change, and currently clears pending timers on close without flushing the underlying Y.Doc update.
- **Docs collab wiring:** `docx-editor/packages/react/src/collab/useCollab.ts` wires HocuspocusProvider, `ySyncPlugin`, cursors, strict co-editing, `yUndoPlugin`, and Y.Maps for metadata, comments, footnotes, endnotes, and document properties.
- **Docs collab host:** `docx-editor/packages/react/src/components/CasualEditor.tsx` passes collab plugins as external content and bridges comments/footnotes/endnotes/properties through the Y.Maps.
- **Save pipeline:** `docx-editor/packages/react/src/components/DocxEditor.tsx` serializes current PM state through `DocumentAgent.toBuffer`; `docx-editor/packages/core/src/agent/DocumentAgent.ts` attempts selective save when possible and falls back to full repack.
- **Autosave:** `docx-editor/packages/react/src/file-source/useFileSourceAutoSave.ts` has interval save, `visibilitychange`/`pagehide` flush, status/error tracking, and focused unit tests; `AutosaveStatus.tsx` exposes an `aria-live` status indicator.
- **Drawing fidelity through PM/Yjs:** shape and text box extensions/conversions carry `rawXml`/`envelopeKey`; image conversion currently does not carry these attributes even though the serializer can emit `Image.rawXml`.
- **Accessibility baseline:** `docx-editor/packages/react/src/paged-editor/HiddenProseMirror.tsx` keeps the real contenteditable screen-reader accessible with `role="textbox"`, `aria-multiline`, and an accessible name while visual pages stay separate.
- **Dark theme implementation:** `DocxEditor.tsx` applies `data-theme` from persisted light/dark/auto mode and `TitleBar.tsx` exposes the theme toggle; the missing gate is measured WCAG contrast across rendered chrome, not absence of a theme switch.
- **Main CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs format, lint, typecheck, unit tests, build, round-trip audit, sharded Chromium Playwright, and Go vet/race/build.
- **Visual fidelity:** `.github/workflows/visual-fidelity.yml` renders representative `.docx` fixtures against LibreOffice references and enforces the configured floor.
- **Fidelity comparison:** `.github/workflows/fidelity-compare.yml` compares against LibreOffice and OnlyOffice DocumentBuilder on demand/main-path changes and uploads reports.
- **Deployment topology:** `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`, `deploy/Caddyfile`, and `deploy/README.md` define the two-service gateway + collab + same-origin `/yjs` shape, but the current storage env/docs must be corrected before calling it production-complete.
- **Collab unit coverage:** `collab/src/**.unit.test.ts` covers room caps/eviction, personal files, share links, ACLs, auth/JWT, join-role resolution, WOPI routes, host backends, admin config, and webhooks.
- **Docs collab transport coverage:** `packages/react/src/collab/*Sync.test.ts` and `strictCoEditing.test.ts` cover props, comments, footnotes, and strict co-editing behavior at unit level.
- **Accessibility/focus/IME coverage:** `editor-a11y.spec.ts`, `accessibility-dialog.spec.ts`, `editor-focus-recapture.spec.ts`, `cursor-focus.spec.ts`, and `ime-caret-sync.spec.ts` cover important baseline contracts, but not a full WCAG/AT matrix.
- **Feature workflow coverage:** Playwright specs exist for version history/preview, track changes, equations, comments, tables, images, find/replace, formatting, markdown, auth gate, export PDF, mobile behavior, and many document-fidelity regressions.
- **Performance coverage:** `performance-large-docs.spec.ts` exists, but production budgets/trend reporting still need to be formalized.
