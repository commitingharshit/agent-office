/**
 * Type declaration for the deskApp desktop bridge.
 *
 * When this Vite demo is loaded inside the deskApp Tauri shell
 * (apps/shell/src-tauri/src/lib.rs `build_bridge_script`), it injects
 * `window.__deskApp__` into the webview before any app JS runs. The demo
 * detects this global and routes Save / Save As / Open through native OS
 * dialogs and direct file I/O instead of the web-app's blob-download flow.
 *
 * Web-only deploys (doc.schnsrw.live, local Vite dev) don't get this
 * global, so the demo falls back to the original browser behavior.
